/*
In firefox 136.0.4, the TabsToolbar has a few things:
	- MacOS window controls
	- A button to "View recent browsing across windows and devices"
	- Horizontal Tabs
	- A button to "Open a new tab"
	- The "alltabs-button" for searching tabs and opening new tabs in containers

I find MacOS window controls useless in general.
With the TreeStyleTabs plugin, I consider the rest useless.
So, collapse the whole thing.

/* The TST Sidebar has a big header that says "Tree Style Tab". I Don't want it */
